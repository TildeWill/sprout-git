# sprout-git cookbook

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal-sprout/sprout-git.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal-sprout/sprout-git)

Recipes to install git related tools on OS X.

### Prerequisites

- [system ruby](.ruby-version)

### Quickstart

```
./sprout
```

## Cookbook Usage

### Recent changes:
* #### remove support for legacy array based format for specifying `projects`

* #### adds projects sub-attributes for update
  - you can now specify that a project should auto-update using the `update: true` attribute (default `false`)

* #### adds projects_settings attribute to allow for global project settings
  also adds subattribute `recursive` to allow all given projects to be cloned recursively
  e.g.
  ```
  node_attributes:
    sprout:
      git:
        projects_settings:
          recursive: true
        projects:
          - github: foo/bar
          - github: pivotal-sprout/sprout-git
  ```
  will cause the git commands:
  ```
  $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:foo/bar.git bar
  $ git clone --recursive git@github.com:pivotal-sprout:sprout-git.git pivotal-sprout
  ```
  to be used

* #### Adds projects sub-attributes for branch, recursive & github
  - you can now clone a specific branch using the `branch: branch_name` attribute (default `master`)
  - you can now clone the repositories submodules using `recursive: true`
    (default false)
  - you can now specify git Github url using `github: account]/repo` syntax. the
     `url` attribute will override this attribute if both are provided.

  e.g.
  ```
  node_attributes:
    sprout:
      git:
        projects:
          - github: pivotal-sprout/sprout-git
            branch: develop
            recursive: true
  ```
  will cause the git command: `$ git clone -b develop --recursive git@github.com:pivotal-sprout/sprout-git.git pivotal-sprout` to be used 

* #### Support for new `brew tap` syntax
  Brew has recently changed the output of each `brew tap` tap from "name-of-tap/homebrew-tap" to "name-of-tap/tap". If you getting an error adding custom taps, update your Cheffile.lock to use the latest sprout-git cookbook by using `librarian-chef update sprout-git`.

* #### Adds git_duet recipe:
  This will install git-duet, which allows git commits to have multiple authors. See the [git-duet repo](https://github.com/git-duet/git-duet)

* #### Adds git_duet_rotate_authors recipe:
  This will add a custom bash_it plugin that causes git-duet to rotate which author is the committer.

* #### Adds git_duet_global recipe:
  This will add a custom bash_it plugin that causes git-duet to set global git properties.

* #### the projects attributes have changed from an array of tuples:
  **NOTE** support for the array syntax has been removed as of 2016-06-08
  ```
  node_attributes:
    sprout:
      git:
        projects:
          - # e.g. ~/workspace/foo
            - foo
            - https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-git.git
  ```
  to an array of hashes:

  ```
  node_attributes:
    sprout:
      git:
        projects:
          - # e.g. ~/workspace/foo
            url: https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-git.git
            name: foo
  ```
  the tuple syntax is deprecated but will continue to work for the near term until enough people have transitioned.  See the Attributes section for more details an the new syntax.

* #### the projects attributes now include a way to run arbitrary commands on the freshly cloned repo:
The commands will be run in sequence.  If one of the commands fails (retunrs non-zero) subsequen commands continue to run and the Sprout run is not affected.  Future runs of sprout would not re-run these commands unless the repo was previously deleted. i.e. they only get run on a fresh clone of the project.

  ```
  node_attributes:
    sprout:
      git:
        projects:
          - # an example that initializes submodules, installs all gems, sets up the databases, runs rspec, and executes other arbitrary commands even with some failing
            url: https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-git.git
            post_clone_commands:
              - git submodule update --init
              - gem install bundler
              - bundle
              - rake db:create db:migrate
              - RAILS_ENV=test rake db:create db:migrate
              - rake spec
              - false
              - echo "I'm still run even though the last command failed"
  ```

* #### Projects no longer explicity set master's upstream branch to origin/master
This is done when the repo is cloned so sprout does not need to explicitly do this.

* #### Projects using the new hash syntax no longer automatically do a `git submodule update --init`
If the project needs to have submodules initialized then those entries should include the command as a post-clone command.  If the soloistrc is still using the legacy tuple syntax which cannot specify post_clone_commands then we continue to run the submodule update --init on all projects regardless of whether they have submodules.

### Attributes:

*NOTE:* All preferences are namespaced under `sprout => git` they include:

* `prefix` &mdash; the email prefix to used by git-pair &mdash; default is `'pair'`
* `domain` &mdash; email address domain to be used by git-pair &mdash; default is `'example.com'`
